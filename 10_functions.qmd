## Review {#sec-review3}

### Relational Data

We've almost exclusively used data frames up to this point. We leveraged relations within our data to pick subsets of the data with functions like `filter()`.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)

msleep |> 
  filter(name == "Cow")

```

Importantly, we almost never used indices or selected data by position, which can lead to errors if the underlying data change. An example of using indices and selecting data by position would be to pick data from **row number 5** and **column number 4**. Using relations in data reduces the chances of making mistakes and leads to clearer code.

## Programming

### Selecting Data

There are other ways to subset data, which are important when working with objects other than data frames. We will focus on `[]`, `[[]]`, and `$`.

#### Atomic Vectors

Much of our work focuses on four of the six types of [atomic vectors](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html#important-types-of-atomic-vector): logical, integer, double, and character. `[]` is useful for subsetting atomic vectors. Consider a vector with the first six letters of the alphabet:

```{r}
letters_short <- letters[1:6]

```

We can use **positive integers** to subset to the first and fifth letters of the alphabet.

```{r}
letters_short[c(1, 5)]

```

We can use **negative integers** to subset to the everything but the first and fifth letters of the alphabet.

```{r}
letters_short[c(-1, -5)]

```

We can use **Booleans** (trues and falses) to subset to the first and fifth letters of the alphabet.

```{r}
letters_short[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]

```

This may seem silly, but we have many ways to create Booleans that we can then use to subset a vector.

```{r}
booleans <- letters_short %in% c("a", "e")

booleans

letters_short[booleans]

```

We can use a **character vector** to subset a named vector.

```{r}
named_vector <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)

named_vector

named_vector[c("a", "c")]

```

We are able to select more than one element with `[]`, which will not be true of `[[]]` and `$`. One thing to look out for is vector recycling. Let's go back to `letters_short`, which is length six, but consider some indices of varying lengths.

```{r}
letters_short[TRUE]

letters_short[c(TRUE, FALSE)]

letters_short[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]

```

::: callout-caution
Wow, R recycles the Booleans. Six is divisible by 1, 2, and 3, so there are many ways to recycle the index to subset `letters_short`. This is dangerous and can quietly cause analytic errors.

#### [`r paste("Exercise", exercise_number)`]{style="color:#1696d2;"}

#| echo: false

exercise_number <- exercise_number + 1
```

1.  Create `letters_short`.
2.  Try subsetting `letters_short` with logical vectors with length four or five. What happens?
:::

#### Lists

`[]`, `[[]]`, and `$` are useful for subsetting lists. `[]` subsets lists differently than `[[]]` and `$`.

Unlike `[]`, which can return multiple elements from a list, `[[]]` and `$` can only return a single element and they drill down into the list.

`[[]]` can select an element by position or name, while `$` can only select an element by name. Consider a list with the first six letters of the alphabet.

Let's start with a visual example.[^r4ds]

[^r4ds]: This example is heavily based on the popular ["salt shaker" example from R4DS](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/base-R.html#lists).

Suppose I have change dish with pennies, quarters, and dimes. In this example, the change dish is a list and the coins are organized into three vectors.

![](images/list1.jpeg){width=50%}

Next, suppose I use `[]` to subset the change dish to just pennies. That is, I write `change["pennies"]`. `[]` returns the pennies AND the dish.

![](images/list2.jpeg){width=50%}

Let's go back to the original change dish. Now, suppose I use `[[]]` to subset the dish to just pennies. That is, I write `change[["pennies"]]`. `[[]]` returns the pennies without the dish. That's because `[[]]` always drills down and drops one layer of list.

![](images/list3.jpeg){width=50%}

Now, let's consider a code example.

```{r}
alphabet <- list(
  vowels = c("a", "e"),
  consonants = c("b", "c", "d", "f")
)

```

We can use `[]` to select the first or second element. In both cases, we get back a smaller list.

```{r}
alphabet[1]

class(alphabet[1])

alphabet[2]

class(alphabet[2])

```

We can use `[[]]` to select the first or second element. Now, we get back a vector instead of a list. `[[]]` simplified the object by removing a level of hierarchy.

```{r}
alphabet[[1]]

class(alphabet[[1]])

```

We can also use `[[]]` to select an object by name.

```{r}
alphabet[["vowels"]]

class(alphabet[["vowels"]])

```

We can use `$` to select either vector by name.

```{r}
alphabet$vowels

class(alphabet$vowels)

```

Referring to objects by name should make for code that is more robust to changing data.

::: panel-tabset
#### Before

```{r}
alphabet1 <- list(
  vowels = c("a", "e"),
  consonants = c("b", "c", "d", "f")
)

alphabet1[[2]]
alphabet1[["consonants"]]

```

#### After

```{r}
alphabet2 <- list(
  vowels = c("a", "e"),
  confusing = "y",
  consonants = c("b", "c", "d", "f")
)

alphabet2[[2]]
alphabet2[["consonants"]]

```
:::

Subsetting lists can be difficult. Fortunately, RStudio has a tool than can help. Click on a list in your global environment. Navigate to the far right and click the list button with a green arrow. This will generate code and add it to the Console.

![](images/lists.png)

Interestingly, this tool avoids `$` and uses `[[]]` to pick the vector by name.

```{r}
alphabet[["vowels"]]

```

### Control Flow

Loops are a fundamental programming tool for iteration; however, they are less common in R than in other programming languages. We encourage the map-reduce framework in the tidyverse's purrr library which we introduce in @sec-purrr. Even so, understanding the for loop and while loop is important because you will likely see them in other programmers' R code, and they are extremely common in other programming languages. 

#### For Loops

For loops have two main pieces: 1. a header and 2. a body. Headers define the number of iterations and potential inputs to the iteration. Bodies are iterated once per iteration. Here is a very simple example:

```{r}
for (i in 1:10) {
  
  print(i)
  
}

```

We can use headers several different ways. Like above, we may just want to repeat the values in the index.

```{r}
fruit <- c("apple", "banana", "cantaloupe")
for (b in fruit) {
  
  print(b)
  
}

```

We can use the header as an index.

```{r}
fruit <- c("apple", "banana", "cantaloupe")
for (i in 1:3) {
  
  print(fruit[i])
  
}

```

We can leverage the index to use results from previous iterations.

```{r}
result <- c(1, NA, NA, NA) 
for (i in 2:4) {
  
  result[i] <- result[i - 1] * 2
  
}

result

```

We've now seen three different ways to use the header.

1.  Simply repeat the elements in the header (e.g. print `i`).
2.  Use the elements in the header as an index (e.g. select the $i^{th}$ element).
3.  Use the header to reference past iterations (e.g. `i - 1`)

::: callout-caution
## Don't grow vectors!

It is tempting to initialize a vector and then grow the vector with a for loop and `c()`. It is also tempting to initialize a data frame and then grow the data frame with `bind_rows()`. Because of R's design, this is computationally very inefficient.

This is slow!:

```{r}
vec <- c(1)

for (i in 2:10) {
  
  vec <- c(vec, i)
  
  
}

vec

```
:::

It is essential to pre-allocate vectors and then fill them in. It is also easy to make mistakes when creating indices (e.g. `1:length(x)` may end up as `c(1, 0)`). `seq_along()` is a helpful alternative to `:`. The following pre-allocates a vector and then uses the length of the vector to create an index.

```{r}
numbers <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = 5)

numbers

for (i in seq_along(numbers)) {
  
  numbers[i] <- i
  
}

numbers

```

Let's consider a simple random walk with 100 steps. In this case, the person starts at location zero and random takes one step forward or one step back.

```{r}
position <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = 100)

set.seed(20230530)
for (iter in 2:length(position)) {
  
  position[iter] <- position[iter - 1] + sample(x = c(-1, 1), size = 1)
  
  
}

position

```

::: callout
#### [`r paste("Exercise", exercise_number)`]{style="color:#1696d2;"}

```{r}
#| echo: false

exercise_number <- exercise_number + 1
```

1.  Create the following list:

```{r}
#| eval: false

alphabet <- list(
  vowels = c("a", "e"),
  confusing = "y",
  consonants = c("b", "c", "d", "f")
)

```

2.  Write a for loop and use `str_to_upper()` from `library(stringr)` to transform all letters to upper case.
:::

#### While Loops

While loops are similar to for loops; however, instead of predetermining the number of iterations in the header, while loops determine a condition in the header and run until that condition is met. This makes them useful for iterating for an unknown number of iterations. Though while loops are less common than for loops, one policy-relevant domain where while loops could be useful is simulation. A while loop could be useful to run a simulation indefinitely until certain conditions are met. Alternatively, both for and while loops could be used to run a simulation a specified number of times. 

```{r}
iteration <- 0
x <- 2

while (x < 1000) {
  
  iteration <- iteration + 1
  x <- x * 2
  
}

x 
iteration

```

::: callout
#### [`r paste("Exercise", exercise_number)`]{style="color:#1696d2;"}

```{r}
#| echo: false

exercise_number <- exercise_number + 1
```

1.  Write the random walk from the for loop above as a while loop. Stop the while loop when `position < -10` or `position > 10`. How many iterations did it take?
:::

#### `if`, `else`, and `else if`

`if_else()` and `case_when()` apply conditional logic to a vector. We most frequently use those functions inside of `mutate()` to create a new variable or manipulate an existing variable.

R also has `if`, `else`, and `else if`, which are used to select sections of code to run. This is incredibly useful when programming outside of data manipulation. For example, we can use `if` to download a file only if it doesn't already exist.

```{r}
#| eval: false
if (!file.exists("data.csv")) {

  download.file(url = "web-url.csv", destfile = "data.csv")

}

```

**Selection** control flow has two important pieces. First, there is a conditional statement inside `()`. If the condition is `TRUE`, then evaluate. If it is `FALSE`, then don't evaluate. Second, there is a body contained in `{}`. Note the formatting in the above example.

The conditional statement must be a single `TRUE` or `FALSE`. If your statement involves more than one Boolean, then consider using `all()`, which evaluates to `TRUE` if everything is `TRUE` and `any()`, which evaluates to `TRUE` if anay element is `TRUE`.

Let's consider a more sophisticated example.

```{r}
#| eval: false

if (distribution == "normal") {
  
  x <- rnorm(n = 100)
  
} else if (distribution == "poisson") {
  
  x <- rpois(n = 100, lambda = 8)
  
} else {
  
  stop("distribution must be normal or poisson")
  
}

```

This style of using `if`, `else if`, and `else` is fundamental for including options in custom functions.


## Custom Functions

### Motivation

Custom functions are an essential building block for good analyses. Custom functions are useful for abiding by the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle. Under our conception of DRY, we should create a function any time we do something three times.

Copying-and-pasting is typically bad because it is easy to make mistakes and we typically want a single source of truth in a script. Custom functions also promote modular code design and testing.

The bottom line: we want to write clear functions that do one and only one thing that are sufficiently tested so we are confident in their correctness.

### Examples

Let's consider a couple of examples from [@barrientos2021]. This paper is a large-scale simulation of formally private mechanisms, which relates to several future chapters of this book. 

Division by zero, which returns `NaN`, can be a real pain when comparing confidential and noisy results when the confidential value is `zero`. This function simply returns `0` when the denominator is `0`. 

```{r}
#' Safely divide number. When zero is in the denominator, return 0. 
#'
#' @param numerator A numeric value for the numerator
#' @param denominator A numeric value for the denominator
#'
#' @return A numeric ratio
#'
safe_divide <- function(numerator, denominator) {
  
  if (denominator == 0) {
    
    return(0)
    
  } else {
    
    return(numerator / denominator)
    
  }
}

```

This function 

1. Implements the laplace or double exponential distribution, which isn't included in base R. 
2. Applies a technique called the laplace mechanism. 

```{r}
#' Apply the laplace mechanism
#'
#' @param eps Numeric epsilon privacy parameter
#' @param gs Numeric global sensitivity for the statistics of interest
#'
#' @return A numeric value sampled from the Laplace distribution
#' 
lap_mech <- function(eps, gs) {
  
  # Checking for proper values
  if (any(eps <= 0)) {
    stop("The eps must be positive.")
  }
  if (any(gs <= 0)) {
    stop("The GS must be positive.")
  }
  
  # Calculating the scale
  scale <- gs / eps

  # Sample from the Laplace (double exponential) distribution
  r <- runif(1)

  if(r > 0.5) {
    r2 <- 1 - r
    x <- 0 - sign(r - 0.5) * scale * log(2 * r2)
  } else {
    x <- 0 - sign(r - 0.5) * scale * log(2 * r)
  }
  
  return(x)
}



```

### Basics

R has a robust system for creating custom functions. To create a custom function, use `function()`:

```{r}
say_hello <- function() {
  
  "hello"
   
}

say_hello()

```

Oftentimes, we want to pass parameters/arguments to our functions:

```{r}
say_hello <- function(name) {
  
  paste("hello,", name)
   
}

say_hello(name = "aaron")

```

We can also specify default values for parameters/arguments:

```{r}
say_hello <- function(name = "aaron") {
  
  paste("hello,", name)
   
}

say_hello()

say_hello(name = "alex")

```

`say_hello()` just prints something to the console. More often, we want to perform a bunch of operations and the then return some object like a vector or a data frame. By default, R will return the last unassigned object in a custom function. It isn't required, but it is good practice to wrap the object to return in `return()`.

It's also good practice to document functions. With your cursor inside of a function, go Insert \> Insert Roxygen Skeleton:

```{r}
#' Say hello
#'
#' @param name A character vector with names
#'
#' @return A character vector with greetings to name
#' 
say_hello <- function(name = "aaron") {
  
  greeting <- paste("hello,", name)
  
  return(greeting)
  
}

say_hello()

```

As you can see from the [Roxygen Skeleton](https://jozef.io/r102-addin-roxytags/) template above, function documentation should contain the following:

-   A description of what the function does
-   A description of each function argument, including the class of the argument (e.g. string, integer, dataframe)
-   A description of what the function returns, including the class of the object

Tips for writing functions:

-   Function names should be short but effectively describe what the function does. Function names should generally be verbs while function arguments should be nouns. See the [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/functions.html) for more details on function naming and style.
-   As a general principle, functions should each do only one task. This makes it much easier to debug your code and reuse functions!
-   Use `::` (e.g. `dplyr::filter()` instead of `filter()`) when writing custom functions. This will create stabler code and make it easier to develop R packages.

### Functions with Multiple Outputs

When `return()` is reached in a function, `return()` is evaluated, evaluation ends and R leaves the function. 

```{r}
sow_return <- function() {
  
  return("The function stops!")
  
  return("This never happens!")
  
}

sow_return()

```

If the end of a function is reached without calling `return()`, the value from the last evaluated expression is returned.

We prefer to include `return()` at the end of functions for clarity even though `return()` doesn't change the behavior of the function. 

Sometimes we want to return more than one vector or data frame. `list()` is very helpful in these situations because it allows us technically to return a single object (the list) while actually passing out multiple objects (the components of the list). 

```{r}
summarize_results <- function(x) {
  
  mean_x <- mean(x)
  
  median_x <- median(x)
  
  results <- list(
    mean = mean_x,
    median = median_x
  )
  
  return(results)
  
}

summarize_results(x = 1:10)

```

### Referential Transparency

R functions, like mathematical functions, should always return the exact same output for a given set of inputs.[^stochastic] This is called referential transparency. R will not enforce this idea, so you must write good code.

[^stochastic]: This rule won't exactly hold if the function contains random or stochastic code. In those cases, the function should return the same output every time if the seed is set with `set.seed()`. 

#### Bad!

```{r}
bad_function <- function(x) {
  
  x * y
  
}

y <- 2
bad_function(x = 2)

y <- 3
bad_function(x = 2)

```

#### Good!

```{r}
good_function <- function(x, y) {
  
  x * y
  
}
  
y <- 2
good_function(x = 2, y = 1)

y <- 3
good_function(x = 2, y = 1)


```

Bruno Rodriguez has a [book](http://modern-rstats.eu/functional-programming.html#properties-of-functions) and a [blog](https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2022-05-26-safer_programs/) that explore this idea further.

## Debugging

R code inside of custom functions can be tougher to troubleshoot than R code outside of custom functions. Fortunately, R has a powerful debugging tool.

The debugger requires putting custom functions in their own scripts. This is covered in @sec-organizing-an-analysis. 

To set up the debugger, simply select the red dot to the left of a line of code in a custom function and then source the custom function. After, there should be a red dot next to the defined function in the global environment.[^environments]

[^environments]: According to Hadley Wickham, "You can think of an environment as a bag of names. Each name points to an object stored elsewhere in memory." For more details, see the [Environments chapter](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Environments.html#env-basics) of Advanced R.

::: {#fig-debuggera layout-ncol="2"}
![](images/debugger1.png){#fig-debugger1}

![](images/debugger2.png){#fig-debugger2}

Setting up the debugger
:::

Now, when the function is called it will stop at the red dot (the stop point). Importantly, the environment should reflect the environment inside of the function instead of the global environment.

::: {#fig-debuggerb layout-ncol="2"}
![](images/debugger3.png){#fig-debugger3}

![](images/debugger4.png){#fig-debugger4}

Using the debugger
:::

Finally, RStudio gives several controls for the debugger. There is a button to Continue to the end of the function. There is a button to Stop execution.

There is also a button with two brackets and a green arrow. This steps the debugger into another function. This is incredibly useful when functions are nested inside of functions.

![](images/debugger5.png)

::: callout
#### [`r paste("Exercise", exercise_number)`]{style="color:#1696d2;"}

```{r}
#| echo: false

exercise_number <- exercise_number + 1
```

1.  Create a custom function with at least three different pieces of R code.
2.  Save the function in a .R script with the same name as the function.
3.  Click the little red dot to the left of first line of code in the .R script.
4.  Source the function with the source button at the top right.
5.  Call the function. You should enter the debugger.

:::

## Benchmarking

Benchmarking is the process of estimating the run time of code. Oftentimes, benchmarking is used to compare multiple pieces of code to pick the more performant code. This raises a couple of issues:

1.  Computing environments differ. My MacBook Pro with Apple M1 chips typically outperforms my work computer.
2.  Other software can slow performance. When I open up Spotify my R processes typically slow down.

We can't solve problem 1 with an R package, but we can solve problem 2 by running tests multiple times. [`library(microbenchmark)`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/microbenchmark/index.html) makes this very easy.

Suppose we are interested in the median of a vector of 1 million numbers. We can easily calculate this with `median()` or `quantile()`. Suppose we are concerned about computation speed, so lets test the code performance:

```{r}
library(microbenchmark)

x <- 1:1000000

microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  median(x),
  quantile(x, probs = 0.5)
)

```

::: callout
#### [`r paste("Exercise", exercise_number)`]{style="color:#1696d2;"}

```{r}
#| echo: false

exercise_number <- exercise_number + 1
```

Let's compare `%>%` and `|>` to see if they have comparable computation times. Consider [this example](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67683626/7109685) from Stack Overflow, which shows `|>` is clearly better.

1.  Load `library(microbenchmark)` and add the `microbenchmark()` function.
2.  Create `x1 <- 1:1000000`, `x2 <- 1:1000000`, and `x3 <- 1:1000000`
3.  Test `median(x1)`, `x2 |> median()`, and `x3 %>% median()`.[^new-pipe]

[^new-pipe]: Don't be surprised when `microbenchmark::microbenchmark()` returns a row with expr `median(x2)` instead of `x2 |> median()`. This is expected behavior because the base pipe is implemented as a syntax transformation. You can read more about this in [this blog](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/05/the-new-r-pipe/).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false

x1 <- 1:1000000
x2 <- 1:1000000
x3 <- 1:1000000

microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  median(x1), 
  x2 |> median(), 
  x3 %>% median()
)

```

:::

## Organizing an Analysis {#sec-organizing-an-analysis}

We recommend writing functions for data analysis. We need a plan for how to add custom functions to our workflow built on RStudio projects and Quarto.

We typically recommending adding a directory called `R` or `src` in a project directory and then sourcing scripts in to Quarto documents. Keeping functions in separate scripts makes the functions easier to use in multiple documents and simplifies the debugging process outlined above.

We typically only add one function to an R script in the `R/` directory and name the script after the function (without parentheses). Next, we source function scripts at the top of Quarto documents after loading packages with the `source()`. [`library(here)`](https://here.r-lib.org/) is essential if when sourcing from a Quarto document that is in a subdirectory of the project.


## Iteration with `library(purrr)` {#sec-purrr}

Most functions in `R` are vectorized. That means a function operates on every element in a vector by default. 

```{r}
teacher_names <- c("aaron", "alex", "alena")

say_hello(name = teacher_names)

```

`say_hello()` is vectorized. It works without iteration, but let's just use it as an example to learn about iteration. Let's start with a simple for loop. 


```{r}
# the vector over which to iterate
teacher_names <- c("aaron", "alex", "alena")

# preallocate the output vector
greetings <- vector(mode = "character", 
                    length = length(teacher_names)
                    )
for (i in seq_along(teacher_names)) {
  
  greetings[i] <- say_hello(teacher_names[i])
  
}

# print the result
greetings

```

That's a lot of typing. It is much more common in R to use `library(purrr)`, which replaces apply functions.[^apply] `map()` iterates over each element of a data structure called `.x`, applies a function called `.f` to each element, and then returns a list.

[^apply]: "Apply functions" refers to a family of base R functions like `lapply()`. The `map()` family is similar, but it has more helper functions. You can read more in [*Advanced R*](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functionals.html).

```{r}
library(purrr)

teacher_names <- c("aaron", "alex", "alena")
map(.x = teacher_names, .f = say_hello)

```

`map()` always returns a list. Sometimes we want to do something called map reduce. Functions like `map_chr()`, `map_dbl()`, and `map_df()` will map reduce. In this case, `map_chr()` returns a character vector instead of a list:


```{r}
map_chr(.x = teacher_names, .f = say_hello)

```

We can quickly add anonymous functions in `map()` and its relatives with `~`. A tibble is just a list of columns. This function iterates over each column, counts the number of missing values, and then returns a named vector.

```{r}
map_dbl(.x = msleep, .f = ~sum(is.na(.x)))

```

The purrr library also has functions that can iterate over multiple inputs simultaneously. To figure out which purrr function to use ask the following:

- How many inputs do I have? Is it one (`map`), two (`map2`), or 3+ (`pmap`)?
- What do I want back? A numeric vector (`dbl`), character vector (`chr`), dataframe created by column-binding (`dfc`), dataframe created by row-binding (`dfr`), etc?

The [purrr cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/purrr.pdf) is a great place to go for help using purrr and outlines the different function options. You can also see the [purrr documentation](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) for more details.


## Conclusion

R has many useful built-in functions, and you can easily install other extremely useful functions by loading in R packages. However, in many cases, it is useful to write your own custom functions. This section illustrated how to write custom R functions with the `function() {}` syntax. When writing R functions, R’s debugger is extremely helpful to implement “break points” which can help identify errors. Custom functions can be especially powerful when combined with iteration, and the tidyverse’s `purrr` package offers an elegant way to apply this concept. Lastly, this section covers other programming fundamentals like `if` `else` statements, `for` loops and `while` loops.
