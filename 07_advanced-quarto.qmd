## Review Exercise {#sec-review}

Let's start with an exercise to review content from the previous section of notes:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)

theme_set(theme_minimal())

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
exercise_number <-  1

```

::: callout
#### [`r paste("Exercise", exercise_number)`]{style="color:#1696d2;"}


1.  In the `hello-quarto.qmd` file you previously created, add `date: today` to your YAML header after `title`. This will update every time the document is rendered.
2.  Copy the Markdown table from [this table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) and add it to your `.qmd` document.
3.  Create a scatter plot of the `cars` data with `library(ggplot2)`. Adjust the figure width and height using options within the chunk.
4.  Click "Render".

## YAMl Header Specifications

### params

As a review, Quarto documents have YAML headers, and YAML headers can contain many output specific settings. This YAML header creates an HTML document with code folding and a floating table of contents:

```         
---
format: 
  html:
    embed-resources: true
    code-fold: true
    toc: true
---  
```

One key specification in the YAML header are parameters or `params`. Here is an example:

```         
---
format: html
params:
  state: "Virginia"
---
```

Now state can be referred to anywhere in R code as `params$state`. 

Parameters are useful for a couple of reasons:

1. We can clearly change key values for a Quarto document in the YAML header. This could be a useful place to define constants and avoid [magic numbers](https://www.inf.unibz.it/~calvanese/teaching/05-06-ip/lecture-notes/uni04/node17.html). 
2. We can create a template and programmatically iterate the template over a set of values with the `quarto_render()` function and `library(purrr)`. [This blog](https://urban-institute.medium.com/iterated-fact-sheets-with-r-markdown-d685eb4eafce) describes the idea and provides example code! The [Mobility Metrics Data Tables](https://upward-mobility.urban.org/measuring-upward-mobility-counties-and-cities-across-us) and [SLFI State Fiscal Briefs](https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-and-local-finance-initiative/projects/state-fiscal-briefs) are key examples of this workflow. The code to create the Mobility Metrics Data Tables is publicly available [on Github](https://github.com/UI-Research/gates-mobility-metrics-pages). 

### embed-resources

::: {.callout-warning}
Unlike R Markdown, images and other content are not embedded in .html from Quarto by default. Be sure to include `embed-resources: true` in YAML headers to embed content and make documents easier to share.

Suppose we embed an image called `image.png` in a Quarto document called `example.qmd`, which, when rendered, creates `example.html`. If we don't include `embed-resources: true`, then we will need to share `image.png` and `example.html` to see the embedded image. This is also true for other files like `.css` which is useful to provide custom styling for websites. 
:::


## Organizing a Quarto Document

It is important to clearly organize a Quarto document and the constellation of files that typically support an analysis. 

1. Always use `.Rproj` files. 
2. Use sub-directories to sort images, `.css`, data.

Later, we will learn how to use `library(here)` to effectively organize sub-directories. 

## Math Notation

This course uses probability and statistics. Occasionally, we want to easily communicate with mathematical notation. For example, it may be convenient to type that $X$ is a random variable that follows a standard normal distribution (mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1).

$$X \sim N(\mu = 0, \sigma = 1)$$

### Math Mode

Use `$` to start and stop in-line math notation and `$$` to start multi-line math notation. Math notation uses LaTeX's syntax for mathematical notation. 

Here's an example with in-line math:

``` markdown
Consider a binomially distributed random variable, $X \sim binom(n, p)$. 
```

Consider a binomially distributed random variable, $X \sim binom(n, p)$.

Here's an example with a chunk of math:

``` markdown
$$
P(X = x) = {n \choose x} p ^ x (1 - p) ^ {n - x}
$${#eq-binomial}
```

$$
P(X = x) = {n \choose x} p ^ x (1 - p) ^ {n - x}
$$ {#eq-binomial}

### Important Syntax

Math mode recognizes basic math symbols available on your keyboard including `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `>`, `<`, `(`, and `)`.

Math mode contains all greek letters. For example, `\alpha` ($\alpha$) and `\beta` ($\beta$).

| LaTeX      | Symbol     |
|------------|------------|
| `\alpha`   | $\alpha$   |
| `\beta`    | $\beta$    |
| `\gamma`   | $\gamma$   |
| `\Delta`   | $\Delta$   |
| `\epsilon` | $\epsilon$ |
| `\theta`   | $\theta$   |
| `\pi`      | $\pi$      |
| `\sigma`   | $\sigma$   |
| `\chi`     | $\chi$     |

: My Caption {#tbl-greek}

Math mode also recognizes $\log(x)$ (`\log(x)`) and $\sqrt{x}$ (`\sqrt{x}`).

Superscripts (`^`) are important for exponentiation and subscripts (`_`) are important for adding indices. `y = x ^ 2` renders as $y = x ^ 2$ and `x_1, x_2, x_3` renders as $x_1, x_2, x_3$. Brackets are useful for multi-character superscripts and subscripts like $s_{11}$ (`s_{11}`).

It is useful to add symbols to letters. For example, `\bar{x}` is useful for sample means ($\bar{x}$), `\hat{y}` is useful for predicted values ($\hat{y}$), and `\vec{\beta}` is useful for vectors of coefficients ($\vec{\beta}$).

Math mode supports fractions with `\frac{x}{y}` ($\frac{x}{y}$), big parentheses with `\left(\right)` ($\left(\right)$), and brackets with `\left[\right]` ($\left[\right]$).

Math mode has a symbol for summation. Let's combine it with bars, fractions, subscripts, and superscipts to show sample mean `\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i^n x_i`, which looks like $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i^n x_i$.

`\sim` is how to add the tilde for distributed as. For example, `X \sim N(\mu = 0, \sigma = 1)` shows the normal distribution $X \sim N(\mu = 0, \sigma = 1)$.

Matrices are are a little bit more work in math mode. Consider the follow variance-covariance matrix:

```         
\begin{bmatrix}
s_{11}^2 & s_{12}\\
s_{21} & s_{22}^2
\end{bmatrix}
```

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
s_{11}^2 & s_{12}\\
s_{21} & s_{22}^2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

[This guide](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) provides and exhaustive look at math options in Quarto.

::: callout-warning
Math mode is finicky! Small errors like mismatched parentheses or superscript and subscript errors will cause Quarto documents to fail to render. Write math carefully and render early and often.

::: callout
#### [`r paste("Exercise", exercise_number)`]{style="color:#1696d2;"}

```{r}
#| echo: false
exercise_number <- exercise_number + 1

```

1.  Use math mode to type out the equation for root mean square error (RMSE).
2.  Do you divide by `n` or `n - 1`?

## Cross References

[Cross references](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html) are useful for organizing documents that include sections, figures, tables, and equations. Cross references create hyperlinks within documents that jump to the locations of these elements. Linking sections, figures, tables, or equations helps readers navigate the document. 

Cross references also automatically number the referenced elements. This means that if there are two tables (ie. Table 1 and Table 2) and a table is added between the two tables, all of the table numbers and references to the tables will automatically update.

Cross references require two bits of code within a Quarto document:

1.  A label associated with the section, figure, table, or equation.
2.  A reference to the labelled section, figure, table, or equation.

Labels are written in brackets or as arguments in code chunks, and begin with the the type object being linked. References begin with `@` followed by the label of object being linked.

### Sections

Linking sections helps readers navigate between sections. Use brackets to label sections after headers and always begin labels with `sec-`. Then you can reference that section with `@sec-`.

``` markdown
## Review {#sec-review}

See @sec-review if you are totally lost.
```

The cross references shows up like this: See @sec-review if you are totally lost.

It can be helpful to turn on section numbering with `number-sections: true` in the YAML header. Additionally, [Markdown has a native method](https://linuxhint.com/markdown-link-section/) for linking between sections.

::: callout
#### [`r paste("Exercise", exercise_number)`]{style="color:#1696d2;"}

```{r}
#| echo: false
exercise_number <- exercise_number + 1

```

1.  Add a few section headers to your Quarto document.
2.  Add a cross reference to one of the section headers.
:::

### Figures

Linking figures helps readers connect narrative text about figures to the actual figures. Use brackets to label figures after adding the figure and always begin labels with fig-. Then you can reference that section with `@fig-`.

``` markdown
![Penguins](images/penguins.png){#fig-penguins fig-align="center" width=70%}
```

![Penguins](images/penguins.png){#fig-penguins fig-align="center" width=70%}

We can reference figures like @fig-penguins with `@fig-penguins`.

### Tables

Linking tables helps readers connect narrative text about tables to the actual tables. Use brackets to label figures after adding the figure and caption, and always begin labels with tbl-. Then you can reference that section with `@tbl-`.

``` markdown
| LaTeX      | Symbol     |
|------------|------------|
| `\alpha`   | $\alpha$   |
| `\beta`    | $\beta$    |
| `\gamma`   | $\gamma$   |
| `\Delta`   | $\Delta$   |
| `\epsilon` | $\epsilon$ |
| `\theta`   | $\theta$   |
| `\pi`      | $\pi$      |
| `\sigma`   | $\sigma$   |
| `\chi`     | $\chi$     |

: My Caption {#tbl-greek}
```

We can link to tables in our documents. For example, we can link to the greek table with `@tbl-greek` @tbl-greek.

### Equations

We can link to equations in our documents. For example, we can link to the binomial distribution in a different chapter with `@eq-binomial`: @eq-binomial.

``` markdown
$$
X \sim Bin(n, p)
$$ {#eq-binomial}
```

::: callout
#### [`r paste("Exercise", exercise_number)`]{style="color:#1696d2;"}

```{r}
#| echo: false
exercise_number <- exercise_number + 1

```

1.  Add a cross reference to your RMSE equation from earlier.

## Citations

### Zotero

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a free and open-source software for organizing research and managing citations.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Digital Object Identifier (DOI)

DOIs are persistent identifiers that uniquely identify objects including many academic papers. For example, `10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098` identifies "A Layered Grammar of Graphics" by Hadley Wickham.
:::

::: callout
#### [`r paste("Exercise", exercise_number)`]{style="color:#1696d2;"}

```{r}
#| echo: false
exercise_number <- exercise_number + 1

```

1.  [Install Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/).
2.  Find the DOI for "Tidy Data" by Hadley Wickham.
3.  Click the magic wand in Zotero and paste the DOI.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "magic-wand.png"))

```

4.  Review the new entry in Zotero.
:::

### Zotero Integration

Zotero has a powerful integration with Quarto. In practice, it's one click to add a DOI to Zotero and then one click to add a citation to Quarto.

RStudio automatically adds **My Library** from Zotero. Simply switch to the Visual Editor (top left in RStudio), click "Insert", and click "Citation". This will open a prompt to insert a citation into the Quarto document. 

The citation is automatically added with parentheses to go at the end of sentences. Delete the square brackets to convert the citation to an in-line citation. 

Inserting the citation automatically adds the citation to the references section. Deleting the reference automatically deletes the citation from the references section. 

Zotero Groups are useful for sharing citations and Zotero Group Libraries need to be added to RStudio. To set this up:

To set this up, in RStudio:

1. Go to Tools and select "Global Options"
2. Select "RMarkdown" and then click "Citations"
3. For "Use Libraries" choose "Selected Libraries"
4. Select the group libraries to add

::: callout

#### [`r paste("Exercise", exercise_number)`]{style="color:#1696d2;"}

```{r}
#| echo: false
exercise_number <- exercise_number + 1

```

1. Cite "Tidy Data" by Hadley Wickham in your Quarto document. 
2. Click "Render"

:::

## Conclusion
 Quarto can handle mathematical equations using `$`. Quarto also has syntax to allow cross references to sections, figures, tables and equations. Lastly, Quarto integrates well with Zotero to handle citations.
