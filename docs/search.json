    "text": "1.1 Review\n\n1.1.1 Motivation\nThere are many problems worth avoiding in an analysis:\n\nCopying-and-pasting, transposing, and manual repetition\nRunning code out-of-order\nMaintaining parallel documents like a script for analysis and a doc for narrative\nCode written for computers that is tough to parse by humans\n\nNot convinced? Maybe we just want to make cool stuff like websites, blogs, books, and slide decks.\nQuarto, a literate statistical programming framework for R, Python, and Julia helps us solve many of these problems. Quarto uses\n\nplain text files ending in .qmd that are similar to .R and .Rmd files\nlibrary(knitr)\npandoc1\n\nQuarto uses library(knitr) and pandoc to convert plain text .qmd documents into rich output documents like these class notes. The “Render” button appears in RStudio with a .qmd file is open in the editor window.\nClicking the “Render” button begins the process of rendering .qmd files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the button is clicked, Quarto calls library(knitr) and renders .qmd (Quarto files) into .md (Markdown files), which Pandoc then converts into any specified output type. Quarto and library(knitr) don’t need to be explicitly loaded as the entire process is handled by clicking the “Render” button in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Quarto website\nQuarto, library(knitr), and Pandoc are all installed with RStudio. You will need to install a LaTeX distribution to render PDFs. We recommend library(tinytex) as a LaTeX distribution (installation instructions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\n\nClick the new script button in RStudio and add a “Quarto Document”.\nGive the document a name, an author, and ensure that HTML is selected.\nSave the document as “hello-quarto.qmd”.\nClick “Render”.\n\n\n\nQuarto has three main ingredients:\n\nYAML header\nMarkdown text\nCode chunks\n\n\n\n1.1.2 (1) YAML Header\nYAML stands for “yet another markup language”. The YAML header contains meta information about the document including output type, document settings, and parameters that can be passed to the document. The YAML header starts with --- and ends with ---.\nHere is the simplest YAML header for a PDF document:\n---\nformat: pdf\n---\nYAML headers can contain many output specific settings. This YAML header creates an HTML document with code folding and a floating table of contents:\n---\nformat: \n  html:\n    embed-resources: true\n    code-fold: true\n    toc: true\n---  \nParameters can be specified as follows\n---\nformat: pdf\nparams:\n  state: \"Virginia\"\n---\nNow state can be referred to anywhere in R code as params$state. Parameters are useful for a couple of reasons:\n\nWe can clearly change key values for a Quarto document in the YAML header.\nWe can create a template and programmatically iterate the template over a set of values with the quarto_render() function and library(purrr). This blog outlines the idea. The Mobility Metrics Data Tables and SLFI State Fiscal Briefs are key examples of this workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nUnlike R Markdown, images and other content are not embedded in .html from Quarto by default. Be sure to include embed-resources: true in YAML headers to embed content and make documents easier to share.\nSuppose we embed an image called image.png in a Quarto document called example.qmd, which, when rendered, creates example.html. If we don’t include embed-resources: true, then we will need to share image.png and example.html to see the embedded image. This is also true for other files like .css.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 (2) Markdown text\nMarkdown is a shortcut for HyperText Markup Language (HTML). Essentially, simple meta characters corresponding to formatting are added to plain text.\nTitles and subtitltes\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Title 1\n\n## Title 2\n\n### Title 3\n\n\nText formatting \n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*italic*  \n\n**bold**   \n\n`code`\n\nLists\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* Bulleted list item 1\n* Item 2\n  * Item 2a\n  * Item 2b\n\n1. Item 1\n2. Item 2\n\nLinks and images\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[text](http://link.com)\n\n![Penguins](images/penguins.png)\n\n\n1.1.4 (3) Code chunks\n\n\n\n\n\nMore frequently, code is added in code chunks:\n\n```{r}\n2 + 2\n```\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nThe first argument inline or in a code chunk is the language engine. Most commonly, this will just be a lower case r. knitr allows for many different language engines:\n\nR\nJulia\nPython\nSQL\nBash\nRcpp\nStan\nJavascript\nCSS\n\nQuarto has a rich set of options that go inside of the chunks and control the behavior of Quarto.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: important-calculation\n#| eval: false\n\n2 + 2\n```\n\nIn this case, eval makes the code not run. Other chunk-specific settings can be added inside the brackets. Here2 are the most important options:\n\n\n\nOption\nEffect\n\n\n\n\necho: false\nHides code in output\n\n\neval: false\nTurns off evaluation\n\n\noutput: false\nHides code output\n\n\nwarning: false\nTurns off warnings\n\n\nmessage: false\nTurns off messages\n\n\nfig-height: 8\nChanges figure width in inches3\n\n\nfig-width: 8\nChanges figure height in inches4\n\n\n\nYou can see the quarto defaults for figure dimensions by format here.\nDefault settings for the entire document can be changed in the YAML header with the execute option:\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\n\nAdd date: today to your YAML header after title. This will update every time the document is rendered.\nCopy the Markdown table from this table generator and add it to your .qmd document.\nCreate a scatter plot of the cars data with library(ggplot2). Adjust the figure width and height using options within the chunk.\nClick “Render”.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Organizing a Quarto Document\nIt is important to clearly organize a Quarto document and the constellation of files that typically support an analysis.\n\nAlways use .Rproj files.\nUse sub-directories to sort images, .css, data.\n\nLater, we will learn how to use library(here) to effectively organize sub-directories."

    "section": "1.2 Math Notation",
    "text": "1.2 Math Notation\nThis course uses probability and statistics. Occasionally, we want to easily communicate with mathematical notation. For example, it may be convenient to type that \\(X\\) is a random variable that follows a standard normal distribution (mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1).\n\\[X \\sim N(\\mu = 0, \\sigma = 1)\\]\n\n1.2.1 Math Mode\nUse $ to start and stop in-line math notation and $$ to start multi-line math notation. Math notation uses LaTeX’s syntax for mathematical notation.\nHere’s an example with in-line math:\nConsider a binomially distributed random variable, $X \\sim binom(n, p)$. \nConsider a binomially distributed random variable, \\(X \\sim binom(n, p)\\).\nHere’s an example with a chunk of math:\n$$\nP(X = x) = {n \\choose x} p ^ x (1 - p) ^ {n - x}\n$${#eq-binomial}\n\\[\nP(X = x) = {n \\choose x} p ^ x (1 - p) ^ {n - x}\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\n\n\n1.2.2 Important Syntax\nMath mode recognizes basic math symbols available on your keyboard including +, -, *, /, &gt;, &lt;, (, and ).\nMath mode contains all greek letters. For example, \\alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)) and \\beta (\\(\\beta\\)).\n\n\nTable 1.1: My Caption\n\n\nLaTeX\nSymbol\n\n\n\n\n\\alpha\n\\(\\alpha\\)\n\n\n\\beta\n\\(\\beta\\)\n\n\n\\gamma\n\\(\\gamma\\)\n\n\n\\Delta\n\\(\\Delta\\)\n\n\n\\epsilon\n\\(\\epsilon\\)\n\n\n\\theta\n\\(\\theta\\)\n\n\n\\pi\n\\(\\pi\\)\n\n\n\\sigma\n\\(\\sigma\\)\n\n\n\\chi\n\\(\\chi\\)\n\n\n\n\nMath mode also recognizes \\(\\log(x)\\) (\\log(x)) and \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) (\\sqrt{x}).\nSuperscripts (^) are important for exponentiation and subscripts (_) are important for adding indices. y = x ^ 2 renders as \\(y = x ^ 2\\) and x_1, x_2, x_3 renders as \\(x_1, x_2, x_3\\). Brackets are useful for multi-character superscripts and subscripts like \\(s_{11}\\) (s_{11}).\nIt is useful to add symbols to letters. For example, \\bar{x} is useful for sample means (\\(\\bar{x}\\)), \\hat{y} is useful for predicted values (\\(\\hat{y}\\)), and \\vec{\\beta} is useful for vectors of coefficients (\\(\\vec{\\beta}\\)).\nMath mode supports fractions with \\frac{x}{y} (\\(\\frac{x}{y}\\)), big parentheses with \\left(\\right) (\\(\\left(\\right)\\)), and brackets with \\left[\\right] (\\(\\left[\\right]\\)).\nMath mode has a symbol for summation. Let’s combine it with bars, fractions, subscripts, and superscipts to show sample mean \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_i^n x_i, which looks like \\(\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_i^n x_i\\).\n\\sim is how to add the tilde for distributed as. For example, X \\sim N(\\mu = 0, \\sigma = 1) shows the normal distribution \\(X \\sim N(\\mu = 0, \\sigma = 1)\\).\nMatrices are are a little bit more work in math mode. Consider the follow variance-covariance matrix:\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ns_{11}^2 & s_{12}\\\\\ns_{21} & s_{22}^2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ns_{11}^2 & s_{12}\\\\\ns_{21} & s_{22}^2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis guide provides and exhaustive look at math options in Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nMath mode is finicky! Small errors like mismatched parentheses or superscript and subscript errors will cause Quarto documents to fail to render. Write math carefully and render early and often.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\n\n\n\n\nUse math mode to type out the equation for root mean square error (RMSE).\nDo you divide by n or n - 1?"

    "section": "1.3 Cross References",
    "text": "1.3 Cross References\nCross references are useful for organizing documents that include sections, figures, tables, and equations. Cross references create hyperlinks within documents that jump to the locations of these elements. Linking sections, figures, tables, or equations helps readers navigate the document.\nCross references also automatically number the referenced elements. This means that if there are two tables (ie. Table 1 and Table 2) and a table is added between the two tables, all of the table numbers and references to the tables will automatically update.\nCross references require two bits of code within a Quarto document:\n\nA label associated with the section, figure, table, or equation.\nA reference to the labelled section, figure, table, or equation.\n\nLabels are written in brackets or as arguments in code chunks, and begin with the the type object being linked. References begin with @ followed by the label of object being linked.\n\n1.3.1 Sections\nLinking sections helps readers navigate between sections. Use brackets to label sections after headers and always begin labels with sec-. Then you can reference that section with @sec-.\n## Review {sec-review}\n\nSee @sec-review if you are totally lost.\nThe cross references shows up like this: See Section 1.1 if you are totally lost.\nIt can be helpful to turn on section numbering with number-sections: true in the YAML header. Additionally, Markdown has a native method for linking between sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4\n\n\n\n\nAdd a few section headers to your Quarto document.\nAdd a cross reference to one of the section headers.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Figures\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Penguins\n\n\nWe can reference figures like Figure 1.1 with @fig-penguins.\n\n\n1.3.3 Tables\nWe can link to tables in our documents. For example, we can link to the greek table with @tbl-greek Table 1.1.\n\n\n1.3.4 Equations\nWe can link to equations in our documents. For example, we can link to the binomial distribution earlier with @eq-binomial Equation 1.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\n\n\n\n\nAdd a cross reference to your RMSE equation from earlier."
