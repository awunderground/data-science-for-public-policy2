In interactive mode, file paths are read as if the .qmd file is in the same folder as the .Rproj. When clicking render, paths are treated as if they are in the subdirectory.\nlibrary(here) resolves headaches around file referencing in project-oriented workflows.\nLoading library(here) will print your working directory.\n\nlibrary(here)\n\nhere() starts at /Users/aaronwilliams/presentations/data-science-for-public-policy2\n\n\nAfter this, here() will use reasonable heuristics to find project files using relative file paths. When placing Quarto documents in a directory below the top-level directory, use here() and treat each folder and file as a different string.\nBefore\n\nread_csv(\"data/raw/important-data.csv\")\n\nAfter\n\nread_csv(here(\"data\", \"raw\", \"important-data.csv\"))\n\n\n\n1.2.2 library(readxl)\nWe will focus on reading data from Excel workbooks. Excel is a bad tool with bad design that has led to many analytical errors. Unfortunately, it’s a dominant tool for storing data and often enters the data science workflow.\nlibrary(readxl) is the premier package for reading data from .xls and .xlsx files. read_excel(), which works like read_csv(), loads data from .xls and .xlsx files.

    "text": "1.3 Tidy\nThe defining opinion of the tidyverse is its wholehearted adoption of tidy data. Tidy data has three features:\n\nEach variable forms a column.\nEach observation forms a row.\nEach type of observational unit forms a dataframe.\n\nlibrary(tidyr) is the main package for tidying untidy data. We’ll practice some skills using examples from three workbooks from the IRS SOI.\npivot_longer() is commonly used for tidying data and for making data longer for library(ggplot2). pivot_longer() has three essential arguments:\n\ncols is a vector of columns to pivot (or not pivot).\nnames_to is a string for the name of the column where the old column names will go (i.e. “series” in the figure).\nvalues_to is a string for the name of the column where the values will go (i.e. “rate” in the figure).\n\n\n\n\n\n\npivot_wider() is the inverse of pivot_longer().\n\nTidying Example 1\n\nUntidyCleaned\n\n\nWhy aren’t the data tidy?\n\ntable1 &lt;- tribble(\n  ~state, ~agi2006, ~agi2016, ~agi2020,\n  \"Alabama\", 95067, 114510, 138244,\n  \"Alaska\", 17458, 23645, 26445,\n  \"Arizona\", 146307, 181691, 245258\n)\n\n\n\nYear is a variable. This data is untidy because year is included in the column names.\n\ntable1 &lt;- tribble(\n  ~state, ~agi2006, ~agi2016, ~agi2020,\n  \"Alabama\", 95067, 114510, 138244,\n  \"Alaska\", 17458, 23645, 26445,\n  \"Arizona\", 146307, 181691, 245258\n)\n\npivot_longer(\n  data = table1, \n  cols = -state, \n  names_to = \"year\", \n  values_to = \"agi\"\n)\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 3\n  state   year       agi\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Alabama agi2006  95067\n2 Alabama agi2016 114510\n3 Alabama agi2020 138244\n4 Alaska  agi2006  17458\n5 Alaska  agi2016  23645\n6 Alaska  agi2020  26445\n7 Arizona agi2006 146307\n8 Arizona agi2016 181691\n9 Arizona agi2020 245258\n\n\nThe year column isn’t useful yet. We’ll fix that later.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyr) contains several functions to split values into multiple cells.\n\nseparate_wider_delim() separates a value based on a delimeter and creates wider data.\nseparate_wider_position() separates a value based on position and creates wider data.\nseparate_longer_delim() separates a value based on a delimeter and creates longer data.\nseparate_longer_position() separates a value based on position and creates longer data.\n\n\n\nTidying Example 2\n\nUntidyCleaned\n\n\nWhy aren’t the data tidy?\n\ntable2 &lt;- tribble(\n  ~state, ~`agi2006|2016|2020`,\n  \"Alabama\", \"95067|114510|138244\",\n  \"Alaska\", \"17458|23645|26445\",\n  \"Arizona\", \"146307|181691|245258\"\n)\n\n\n\nThe values for 2006, 2016, and 2020 are all squished into one cell.\n\ntable2 &lt;- tribble(\n  ~state, ~`agi2006|2016|2020`,\n  \"Alabama\", \"95067|114510|138244\",\n  \"Alaska\", \"17458|23645|26445\",\n  \"Arizona\", \"146307|181691|245258\"\n)\n\nseparate_wider_delim(\n  data = table2, \n  cols = `agi2006|2016|2020`, \n  delim = \"|\",\n  names = c(\"2006\", \"2016\", \"2020\")\n) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -state,\n    names_to = \"year\", \n    values_to = \"agi\"\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 3\n  state   year  agi   \n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n1 Alabama 2006  95067 \n2 Alabama 2016  114510\n3 Alabama 2020  138244\n4 Alaska  2006  17458 \n5 Alaska  2016  23645 \n6 Alaska  2020  26445 \n7 Arizona 2006  146307\n8 Arizona 2016  181691\n9 Arizona 2020  245258\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbind_rows() combines data frames by stacking the rows. bind_cols() combines data frames by appending columns. When possible, we recommend using relational joins like left_join() to combine by columns because it is easy to miss-align rows with bind_cols().\n\n\nTidying Example 3\n\nUntidyCleaned\n\n\nWhy aren’t the data tidy?\n\ntable3_2006 &lt;- tribble(\n  ~state, ~agi,\n  \"Alabama\", \"95067\",\n  \"Alaska\", \"17458\",\n  \"Arizona\", \"146307\"\n)\n\ntable3_2016 &lt;- tribble(\n  ~state, ~agi,\n  \"Alabama\", \"114510\",\n  \"Alaska\", \"23645\",\n  \"Arizona\", \"181691\"\n)\n\ntable3_2020 &lt;- tribble(\n  ~state, ~`agi`,\n  \"Alabama\", \"138244\",\n  \"Alaska\", \"26445\",\n  \"Arizona\", \"245258\"\n)\n\n\n\nThe variable year is contained in the data set names. The .id argument in bind_rows() allows us to create the year variable.\n\ntable3_2006 &lt;- tribble(\n  ~state, ~agi,\n  \"Alabama\", 95067,\n  \"Alaska\", 17458,\n  \"Arizona\", 146307\n)\n\ntable3_2016 &lt;- tribble(\n  ~state, ~agi,\n  \"Alabama\", 114510,\n  \"Alaska\", 23645,\n  \"Arizona\", 181691\n)\n\ntable3_2020 &lt;- tribble(\n  ~state, ~`agi`,\n  \"Alabama\", 138244,\n  \"Alaska\", 26445,\n  \"Arizona\", 245258\n)\n\nbind_rows(\n  `2006` = table3_2006,\n  `2016` = table3_2016,\n  `2020` = table3_2020,\n  .id = \"year\"\n)\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 3\n  year  state      agi\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2006  Alabama  95067\n2 2006  Alaska   17458\n3 2006  Arizona 146307\n4 2016  Alabama 114510\n5 2016  Alaska   23645\n6 2016  Arizona 181691\n7 2020  Alabama 138244\n8 2020  Alaska   26445\n9 2020  Arizona 245258\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelational joins are fundamental to working with tidy data. Tidy data can only contain one unit of observation (e.g. county or state not county and state). When data exist on multiple levels, they must be stored in separate tables that can later be combined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMutating Joins\n\n\n\nMutating joins add new variables to a data frame by matching observations from one data frame to observations in another data frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering Joins\n\n\n\nFiltering joins drop observations based on the presence of their key (identifier) in another data frame.\nFor example, we may have a list of students in detention and a list of all students. We can use a filtering join to create a list of student not in detention.\n\n\nFor now, we will focus on mutating joins. Let their be two data frames x and y and let both data frames have a key variable that uniquely identifies rows.\n\nleft_join() appends variables from y on to x but only keeps observations from x.\nfull_join() appends variables from y on to x and keeps all observations from x and y.\nanti_join() returns all observations from x without a match in y. anti_join() is traditionally only used for filtering joins, but it is useful for writing tests for mutating joins.\n\nTo learn more, read the Joins chapter of R for Data Science (2e).\n\n\nTidying Example 4\n\nUntidyCleaned\n\n\nWhy aren’t the data tidy?\n\ntable4a &lt;- tribble(\n  ~state, ~agi,\n  \"Alabama\", 95067,\n  \"Alaska\", 17458,\n  \"Arizona\", 146307\n)\n\ntable4b &lt;- tribble(\n  ~state, ~returns,\n  \"Alabama\", 1929941,\n  \"Alaska\", 322369,\n  \"Arizona\", 2454951\n)\n\n\n\nThese data are tidy! But keeping the data in two separate data frames may not make sense. Let’s use full_join() to combine the data and anti_join() to see if there are mismatches.\n\ntable4a &lt;- tribble(\n  ~state, ~agi,\n  \"Alabama\", 95067,\n  \"Alaska\", 17458,\n  \"Arizona\", 146307\n)\n\ntable4b &lt;- tribble(\n  ~state, ~returns,\n  \"Alabama\", 1929941,\n  \"Alaska\", 322369,\n  \"Arizona\", 2454951\n)\n\nfull_join(table4a, table4b, by = \"state\")\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  state      agi returns\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Alabama  95067 1929941\n2 Alaska   17458  322369\n3 Arizona 146307 2454951\n\nanti_join(table4a, table4b, by = \"state\")\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 2\n# ℹ 2 variables: state &lt;chr&gt;, agi &lt;dbl&gt;\n\nanti_join(table4b, table4a, by = \"state\")\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 2\n# ℹ 2 variables: state &lt;chr&gt;, returns &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\n\n\n\n\nUse pivot_longer() to make the SOI percentile data from the earlier exercise longer. After the transformation, there should be one row per percentile per state.\n\n\n\n\nTidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way. ~ Hadley Wickham\n\nTo see more examples, read the tidy data section in R for Data Science (2e)"

Consider the common situation when zeros are dropped from the beginning of FIPS codes.\n\ntibble(fips = c(1, 2, 4)) |&gt;\n  mutate(fips = str_pad(fips, side = \"left\", pad = \"0\", width = 2))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 1\n  fips \n  &lt;chr&gt;\n1 01   \n2 02   \n3 04   \n\n\n\n\nModifying Strings\nstr_replace(), str_replace_all(), str_remove(), and str_remove_all() can delete or modify parts of strings. Consider an example where we have course names and we want to delete everything except numeric digits.\n\ntibble(course = c(\"PPOL 670\", \"GOVT 8009\", \"PPOL 6819\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(course = str_remove(course, pattern = \"[:alpha:]*\\\\s\"))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 1\n  course\n  &lt;chr&gt; \n1 670   \n2 8009  \n3 6819  \n\n\nstr_c() and str_glue() are useful for joining strings. Consider an example where we want to “fill in the blank” with a variable in a data frame.\n\ntibble(fruit = c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cantelope\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(sentence = str_glue(\"my favorite fruit is {fruit}\"))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  fruit     sentence                      \n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;glue&gt;                        \n1 apple     my favorite fruit is apple    \n2 banana    my favorite fruit is banana   \n3 cantelope my favorite fruit is cantelope\n\n\nThis workflow is useful for building up URLs when accessing APIs, scraping information from the Internet, and downloading many files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4\n\n\n\n\nUse mutate() and library(stringr) to create a variable for year from the earlier SOI exercise. For instance, \"agi2006\" should be \"2006\".\nUse as.numeric() to convert the string from step 1 into a numeric value.\nCreate a data visualization with year on the x-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Factors\nCheck out the forcats cheat sheet.\nMuch of our work focuses on four of the six types of atomic vectors: logical, integer, double, and character. R also contains augmented vectors like factors.\nFactors are categorical data stored as integers with a levels attribute. Character vectors often work well for categorical data and many of R’s functions convert character vectors to factors. This happens with lm().\nFactors have many applications:\n\nGiving the levels of a categorical variable non-alpha numeric order in a ggplot2 data visualization.\nRunning calculations on data with empty groups.\nRepresenting categorical outcome variables in classification models.\n\n\nFactor Basics\n\nx1 &lt;- factor(c(\"a\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"), levels = c(\"d\", \"c\", \"b\", \"a\"))\n\nx1\n\n[1] a a b c\nLevels: d c b a\n\nattributes(x1)\n\n$levels\n[1] \"d\" \"c\" \"b\" \"a\"\n\n$class\n[1] \"factor\"\n\nlevels(x1)\n\n[1] \"d\" \"c\" \"b\" \"a\"\n\n\nx1 has order but it isn’t ordinal. Sometimes we’ll come across ordinal factor variables, like with the diamonds data set. Unintentional ordinal variables can cause unexpected errors.

The ISO 8601 date format is an international standard with appealing properties like fixed lengths and self ordering. The format is YYYY-MM-DD.\nlibrary(lubridate) has useful functions that will take dates of any format and convert them to the ISO 8601 standard.\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\nmdy(\"March 14, 1992\")\n\n[1] \"1992-03-14\"\n\nmdy(\"03/14/1992\")\n\n[1] \"1992-03-14\"\n\ndmy(\"14/03/1992\")\n\n[1] \"1992-03-14\"\n\ndmy(\"14th of March '92\")\n\n[1] \"1992-03-14\"\n\n\nThese functions return variables of class \"Date\".\n\nclass(mdy(\"March 14, 1992\"))\n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\n\nlibrary(lubridate) also contains functions for parsing date times into ISO 8601 standard. Times are slightly trickier because of time zones.\n\nmdy_hms(\"12/02/2021 1:00:00\")\n\n[1] \"2021-12-02 01:00:00 UTC\"\n\nmdy_hms(\"12/02/2021 1:00:00\", tz = \"EST\")\n\n[1] \"2021-12-02 01:00:00 EST\"\n\nmdy_hms(\"12/02/2021 1:00:00\", tz = \"America/Chicago\")\n\n[1] \"2021-12-02 01:00:00 CST\"\n\n\nBy default, library(lubridate) will put the date times in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is the successor to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). I recommend carefully reading the data dictionary if time zones are important for your analysis or if your data cross time zones. This is especially important during time changes (e.g. “spring forward” and “fall back”).\nFortunately, if you encode your dates or date-times correctly, then library(lubridate) will automatically account for time changes, time zones, leap years, leap seconds, and all of the quirks of dates and times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\n\n\n\n\ndates &lt;- tribble(\n  ~date,\n  \"12/01/1987\",\n  \"12/02/1987\",\n  \"12/03/1987\"\n)\n\n\nCreate the dates data from above with tribble().\nUse mutate() to convert the date column to the ISO 8601 standard.\n\n\n\n\nExtracting Components\nlibrary(lubridate) contains functions for extracting components from dates like the year, month, day, and weekday. Conisder the follow data set about full moons in Washington, DC in 2023.\n\nfull_moons &lt;- tribble(\n  ~full_moon,\n  \"2023-01-06\",\n  \"2023-02-05\",\n  \"2023-03-07\",\n  \"2023-04-06\",\n  \"2023-05-05\",\n  \"2023-06-03\",\n  \"2023-07-03\",\n  \"2023-08-01\",\n  \"2023-08-30\",\n  \"2023-09-29\",\n  \"2023-10-28\",\n  \"2023-11-27\",\n  \"2023-12-26\"\n) |&gt;\n  mutate(full_moon = as_date(full_moon))\n\nSuppose we want to know the weekday of each full moon.\n\nfull_moons |&gt;\n  mutate(week_day = wday(full_moon, label = TRUE))\n\n# A tibble: 13 × 2\n   full_moon  week_day\n   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;ord&gt;   \n 1 2023-01-06 Fri     \n 2 2023-02-05 Sun     \n 3 2023-03-07 Tue     \n 4 2023-04-06 Thu     \n 5 2023-05-05 Fri     \n 6 2023-06-03 Sat     \n 7 2023-07-03 Mon     \n 8 2023-08-01 Tue     \n 9 2023-08-30 Wed     \n10 2023-09-29 Fri     \n11 2023-10-28 Sat     \n12 2023-11-27 Mon     \n13 2023-12-26 Tue     \n\n\n\n\nMath\nlibrary(lubridate) easily handles math with dates and date-times. Suppose we want to calculate the number of days since American Independence Day:\n\ntoday() - as_date(\"1776-07-04\")\n\nTime difference of 90251 days\n\n\nIn this case, subtraction creates an object of class difftime represented in days. We can use the difftimes() function to calculate differences in other units.\n\ndifftime(today(), as_date(\"1776-07-04\"), units = \"mins\")\n\nTime difference of 129961440 mins\n\n\n\n\nPeriods\nPeriods track time like a clock or a calendar. We use periods when we set a recurring meetings on a calendar and when we set an alarm to wake up in the morning.\nThis can lead to some interesting results. Do we always add 365 days when we add 1 year to a date? With periods, this isn’t true. Sometimes we add 366 days during leap years. For example,\n\nstart &lt;- as_date(\"1999-03-14\")\nend &lt;- start + years(1)\n\nend\n\n[1] \"2000-03-14\"\n\nend - start\n\nTime difference of 366 days\n\n\n\n\nDurations\nDurations track time in physical time. Duration functions start with d like dyears() and dminutes().\n\nstart &lt;- as_date(\"1999-03-14\")\nend &lt;- start + dyears(1)\n\nend\n\n[1] \"2000-03-13 06:00:00 UTC\"\n\n\nNow we always add 365 days, but we see that March 13th is one year after March 14th.\n\n\nIntervals\nUntil now, we’ve focused on points in time. Intervals have length and have a starting point and an ending point.\nSuppose classes start on August 23rd and proceed every week for a while. Do any of these dates conflict with Georgetown’s fall break?\n\nclasses &lt;- as_date(\"2023-08-23\") + weeks(0:15)\n\nfall_break &lt;- interval(as_date(\"2023-11-22\"), as_date(\"2023-11-26\"))\n\nclasses %within% fall_break\n\n [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[13] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nWe focused on dates, but many of the same principles hold for date-dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6\n\n\n\n\nCreate a date object for your birth date.\nCalculate the number of days since your birth date.\nCreate a vector of your birthdays from your birth date for the next 120 years. Do you use periods or durations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.4 Missing Data\nMissing data are ever present in data analysis. R stores missing values as NA, which are contagious and are fortunately difficult to ignore.\nreplace_na() is the quickest function to replace missing values. It is a shortcut for a specific instance of if_else().\n\nx &lt;- c(1, NA, 3)\n\nif_else(condition = is.na(x), true = 2, false = x)\n\n[1] 1 2 3\n\nreplace_na(x, replace = 2)\n\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n\nWe recommend avoiding arguments like na.rm and using filter() for structurally missing values and replace_na() or imputation for nonresponse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7\n\n\n\nLet’s focus on different data shared by SOI. Now we’ll focus on individual income and tax data by state.\nThis Excel workbook is a beast. For instance, it isn’t clear how the hierarchy works. I expected all of the rows nested under “Number of returns” to sum up to the number of returns. Unfortunately, the rows are not disjoint. Also, the merged cells for column headers are very difficult to use with programming languages.\n\nStart with 20in01al.xlsx.\nCreate a tidy data frame with rows 10 through 12 (“Number of single returns”, “Number of joint returns”, and “Number of head of household returns”) disaggregated by “size of adjusted gross income”."
