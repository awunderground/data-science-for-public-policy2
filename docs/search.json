    "text": "1.1 Review\n\n1.1.1 Motivation\nThere are many problems worth avoiding in an analysis:\n\nCopying-and-pasting, transposing, and manual repetition\nRunning code out-of-order\nMaintaining parallel documents like a script for analysis and a doc for narrative\nCode written for computers that is tough to parse by humans\n\nNot convinced? Maybe we just want to make cool stuff like websites, blogs, books, and slide decks.\nQuarto, a literate statistical programming framework for R, Python, and Julia helps us solve many of these problems. Quarto uses\n\nplain text files ending in .qmd that are similar to .R and .Rmd files\nlibrary(knitr)\npandoc1\n\nQuarto uses library(knitr) and pandoc to convert plain text .qmd documents into rich output documents like these class notes. The “Render” button appears in RStudio with a .qmd file is open in the editor window.\nClicking the “Render” button begins the process of rendering .qmd files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the button is clicked, Quarto calls library(knitr) and renders .qmd (Quarto files) into .md (Markdown files), which Pandoc then converts into any specified output type. Quarto and library(knitr) don’t need to be explicitly loaded as the entire process is handled by clicking the “Render” button in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Quarto website\nQuarto, library(knitr), and Pandoc are all installed with RStudio. You will need to install a LaTeX distribution to render PDFs. We recommend library(tinytex) as a LaTeX distribution (installation instructions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\n\nClick the new script button in RStudio and add a “Quarto Document”.\nGive the document a name, an author, and ensure that HTML is selected.\nSave the document as “hello-quarto.qmd”.\nClick “Render”.\n\n\n\nQuarto has three main ingredients:\n\nYAML header\nMarkdown text\nCode chunks\n\n\n\n1.1.2 (1) YAML Header\nYAML stands for “yet another markup language”. The YAML header contains meta information about the document including output type, document settings, and parameters that can be passed to the document. The YAML header starts with --- and ends with ---.\nHere is the simplest YAML header for a PDF document:\n---\nformat: pdf\n---\nYAML headers can contain many output specific settings. This YAML header creates an HTML document with code folding and a floating table of contents:\n---\nformat: \n  html:\n    embed-resources: true\n    code-fold: true\n    toc: true\n---  \nParameters can be specified as follows\n---\nformat: pdf\nparams:\n  state: \"Virginia\"\n---\nNow state can be referred to anywhere in R code as params$state. Parameters are useful for a couple of reasons:\n\nWe can clearly change key values for a Quarto document in the YAML header.\nWe can create a template and programmatically iterate the template over a set of values with the quarto_render() function and library(purrr). This blog outlines the idea. The Mobility Metrics Data Tables and SLFI State Fiscal Briefs are key examples of this workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nUnlike R Markdown, images and other content are not embedded in .html from Quarto by default. Be sure to include embed-resources: true in YAML headers to embed content and make documents easier to share.\nSuppose we embed an image called image.png in a Quarto document called example.qmd, which, when rendered, creates example.html. If we don’t include embed-resources: true, then we will need to share image.png and example.html to see the embedded image. This is also true for other files like .css.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 (2) Markdown text\nMarkdown is a shortcut for HyperText Markup Language (HTML). Essentially, simple meta characters corresponding to formatting are added to plain text.\nTitles and subtitltes\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Title 1\n\n## Title 2\n\n### Title 3\n\n\nText formatting \n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*italic*  \n\n**bold**   \n\n`code`\n\nLists\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* Bulleted list item 1\n* Item 2\n  * Item 2a\n  * Item 2b\n\n1. Item 1\n2. Item 2\n\nLinks and images\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[text](http://link.com)\n\n![Penguins](images/penguins.png)\n\n\n1.1.4 (3) Code chunks\n\n\n\n\n\nMore frequently, code is added in code chunks:\n\n```{r}\n2 + 2\n```\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nThe first argument inline or in a code chunk is the language engine. Most commonly, this will just be a lower case r. knitr allows for many different language engines:\n\nR\nJulia\nPython\nSQL\nBash\nRcpp\nStan\nJavascript\nCSS\n\nQuarto has a rich set of options that go inside of the chunks and control the behavior of Quarto.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: important-calculation\n#| eval: false\n\n2 + 2\n```\n\nIn this case, eval makes the code not run. Other chunk-specific settings can be added inside the brackets. Here2 are the most important options:\n\n\n\nOption\nEffect\n\n\n\n\necho: false\nHides code in output\n\n\neval: false\nTurns off evaluation\n\n\noutput: false\nHides code output\n\n\nwarning: false\nTurns off warnings\n\n\nmessage: false\nTurns off messages\n\n\nfig-height: 8\nChanges figure width in inches3\n\n\nfig-width: 8\nChanges figure height in inches4\n\n\n\nYou can see the quarto defaults for figure dimensions by format here.\nDefault settings for the entire document can be changed in the YAML header with the execute option:\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\n\nAdd date: today to your YAML header after title. This will update every time the document is rendered.\nCopy the Markdown table from this table generator and add it to your .qmd document.\nCreate a scatter plot of the cars data with library(ggplot2). Adjust the figure width and height using options within the chunk.\nClick “Render”.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Organizing a Quarto Document\nIt is important to clearly organize a Quarto document and the constellation of files that typically support an analysis.\n\nAlways use .Rproj files.\nUse sub-directories to sort images, .css, data.\n\nLater, we will learn how to use library(here) to effectively organize sub-directories."

    "section": "1.2 Math Notation",
    "text": "1.2 Math Notation\nThis course uses probability and statistics. Occasionally, we want to easily communicate with mathematical notation. For example, it may be convenient to type that \\(X\\) is a random variable that follows a standard normal distribution (mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1).\n\\[X \\sim N(\\mu = 0, \\sigma = 1)\\]\n\n1.2.1 Math Mode\nUse $ to start and stop in-line math notation and $$ to start multi-line math notation. Math notation uses LaTeX’s syntax for mathematical notation.\nHere’s an example with in-line math:\nConsider a binomially distributed random variable, $X \\sim binom(n, p)$. \nConsider a binomially distributed random variable, \\(X \\sim binom(n, p)\\).\nHere’s an example with a chunk of math:\n$$\nP(X = x) = {n \\choose x} p ^ x (1 - p) ^ {n - x}\n$${#eq-binomial}\n\\[\nP(X = x) = {n \\choose x} p ^ x (1 - p) ^ {n - x}\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\n\n\n1.2.2 Important Syntax\nMath mode recognizes basic math symbols available on your keyboard including +, -, *, /, &gt;, &lt;, (, and ).\nMath mode contains all greek letters. For example, \\alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)) and \\beta (\\(\\beta\\)).\n\n\nTable 1.1: My Caption\n\n\nLaTeX\nSymbol\n\n\n\n\n\\alpha\n\\(\\alpha\\)\n\n\n\\beta\n\\(\\beta\\)\n\n\n\\gamma\n\\(\\gamma\\)\n\n\n\\Delta\n\\(\\Delta\\)\n\n\n\\epsilon\n\\(\\epsilon\\)\n\n\n\\theta\n\\(\\theta\\)\n\n\n\\pi\n\\(\\pi\\)\n\n\n\\sigma\n\\(\\sigma\\)\n\n\n\\chi\n\\(\\chi\\)\n\n\n\n\nMath mode also recognizes \\(\\log(x)\\) (\\log(x)) and \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) (\\sqrt{x}).\nSuperscripts (^) are important for exponentiation and subscripts (_) are important for adding indices. y = x ^ 2 renders as \\(y = x ^ 2\\) and x_1, x_2, x_3 renders as \\(x_1, x_2, x_3\\). Brackets are useful for multi-character superscripts and subscripts like \\(s_{11}\\) (s_{11}).\nIt is useful to add symbols to letters. For example, \\bar{x} is useful for sample means (\\(\\bar{x}\\)), \\hat{y} is useful for predicted values (\\(\\hat{y}\\)), and \\vec{\\beta} is useful for vectors of coefficients (\\(\\vec{\\beta}\\)).\nMath mode supports fractions with \\frac{x}{y} (\\(\\frac{x}{y}\\)), big parentheses with \\left(\\right) (\\(\\left(\\right)\\)), and brackets with \\left[\\right] (\\(\\left[\\right]\\)).\nMath mode has a symbol for summation. Let’s combine it with bars, fractions, subscripts, and superscipts to show sample mean \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_i^n x_i, which looks like \\(\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_i^n x_i\\).\n\\sim is how to add the tilde for distributed as. For example, X \\sim N(\\mu = 0, \\sigma = 1) shows the normal distribution \\(X \\sim N(\\mu = 0, \\sigma = 1)\\).\nMatrices are are a little bit more work in math mode. Consider the follow variance-covariance matrix:\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ns_{11}^2 & s_{12}\\\\\ns_{21} & s_{22}^2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ns_{11}^2 & s_{12}\\\\\ns_{21} & s_{22}^2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis guide provides and exhaustive look at math options in Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nMath mode is finicky! Small errors like mismatched parentheses or superscript and subscript errors will cause Quarto documents to fail to render. Write math carefully and render early and often.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\n\n\n\n\nUse math mode to type out the equation for root mean square error (RMSE).\nDo you divide by n or n - 1?"

    "text": "1.3 Cross References\nCross references are useful for organizing documents that include sections, figures, tables, and equations. Cross references create hyperlinks within documents that jump to the locations of these elements. Linking sections, figures, tables, or equations helps readers navigate the document.\nCross references also automatically number the referenced elements. This means that if there are two tables (ie. Table 1 and Table 2) and a table is added between the two tables, all of the table numbers and references to the tables will automatically update.\nCross references require two bits of code within a Quarto document:\n\nA label associated with the section, figure, table, or equation.\nA reference to the labelled section, figure, table, or equation.\n\nLabels are written in brackets or as arguments in code chunks, and begin with the the type object being linked. References begin with @ followed by the label of object being linked.\n\n1.3.1 Sections\nLinking sections helps readers navigate between sections. Use brackets to label sections after headers and always begin labels with sec-. Then you can reference that section with @sec-.\n## Review {sec-review}\n\nSee @sec-review if you are totally lost.\nThe cross references shows up like this: See Section 1.1 if you are totally lost.\nIt can be helpful to turn on section numbering with number-sections: true in the YAML header. Additionally, Markdown has a native method for linking between sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4\n\n\n\n\nAdd a few section headers to your Quarto document.\nAdd a cross reference to one of the section headers.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Figures\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Penguins\n\n\nWe can reference figures like Figure 1.1 with @fig-penguins.\n\n\n1.3.3 Tables\nWe can link to tables in our documents. For example, we can link to the greek table with @tbl-greek Table 1.1.\n\n\n1.3.4 Equations\nWe can link to equations in our documents. For example, we can link to the binomial distribution earlier with @eq-binomial Equation 1.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\n\n\n\n\nAdd a cross reference to your RMSE equation from earlier."

For each of the distributions, there are well-defined and straightforward ways to sample values from the distribution.

Sometimes the latent variable is meaningful but unobserved. Sometimes it isn’t meaningful.\nLatent variables are sometimes called hidden variables.\n\n\nBreaking complex problems into smaller pieces is good. These latent variables will allow us to do some cools things:\n\nSimply express complicated probability distributions\nMake inferences about complex populations\nCluster data\n\nIn this set of notes, we’ll use latent variables to\n\nConstruct mixture distributions\nCluster data\n\nLet’s consider a “data generation story” different than anything we considered in Chapter 5. Here, we sample in two stages (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 2009).\n\nSample from a discrete probability distribution with \\(k\\) unique values (i.e. Bernoulli distribution when \\(k = 2\\) and categorical distribution when \\(k &gt; 2\\)).\nSample from one of \\(k\\) different distributions conditional on the outcome of step 1.\n\nThis new sampling procedure aligns closely with the idea of hierarchical sampling and hierarchical models. It is also sometimes called ancestral sampling [ancestral sampling: sample z_hat, sample x_hat|z_hat (Bishop 430)].\nThis two-step approach dramatically increases the types of distributions at our disposal because we are no longer limited to common univariate distributions like the normal distribution and uniform distribution. The two-step approach is also the foundation of two related tools:\n\nMixture distributions: Distributions expressed as the linear combination of other distributions. Mixture distributions can be very complicated distributions expressed in terms of simple distributions with known properties.\nMixture modeling: Statistical inference about sub-populations made only with pooled data without labels for the sub populations.\n\nWith mixture distributions, we care about the overall distribution and don’t care about the latent variables.\nWith mixture modeling, we use the overall distribution to learn about the latent variables/sub populations/clusters in the data."

    "text": "2.6 Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM)\n\n\n\nGaussian mixture modeling (GMM) is mixture modeling that uses normal and multivariate normal distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHard Assignment\n\n\n\nHard assignment assigns an observation in a clustering model to one and only one group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoft Assignment\n\n\n\nSoft assignment assigns an observation in a clustering model to all groups with varying weights or probabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\n\nSoft assignments are quantified with responsibilities. Responsibilities are the probability that a given observation belongs to a given group. The soft assignments for an observation sum to 1.\nWe quantified responsibilities with \\(\\pi_k\\) for mixture distributions. Responsibilities are parameters we will infer during mixture modeling.\n\n\nThere are two main differences between K-Means Clustering and GMM.\n\nInstead of calculating Euclidean distance from each observation to each group centroid, we use multivariate normal distributions to calculate the probability that an observation belongs to each group.\n\nObservations close to the means of a mixture will have a high relative probability of belonging to that mixture.\nObservations far from the means of a mixture will have a low relative probability of belonging to that mixture.\n\nInstead of simply updating \\(k\\) group centroids, we must update \\(k\\) multivariate normal distributions. This requires calculating a vector of means and a variance-covariance matrix for each of the \\(k\\) groups.\n\n\n2.6.1 Example 3\nThe parameters in example 2 were estimated using GMM. Let’s repeat a similar exercise with the faithful using eruptions and waiting instead of just eruptions. We’ll assume there are three groups.\n\n# fit GMM\ngmm2_geyser &lt;- Mclust(faithful, G = 3)\n\nLet’s plot the multivariate normal distributions.

The function contains several different types of models for the variances of the multivariate normal distributions. The defaults are sensible. G is the number of groups. If G isn’t specified, then Mclust() will try 1:9 and pick the G with the lowest BIC.\nplot() with what = \"uncertainty\" creates a very useful data visualization for seeing the multivariate normal distributions and classifications for low-dimensional GMM.\nglance(), tidy(), and augment() from library(broom) return important information about the assignments, groups, and model diagnostics.\n\n\n2.6.3 Estimation\nSuppose we have \\(n\\) observations, \\(k\\) groups, and \\(p\\) variables. A single GMM will have a \\(n x k\\) matrix of responsibilities, \\(k\\) vectors of means of length \\(p\\), and \\(k\\) \\(p x p\\) variance-covariance matrices.\nWe want the maximum likelihood estimates for all of the parameters in the model. For technical reasons, it is very difficult to get these estimates using popular methods like stochastic gradient descent.\nInstead, we will use expectations maximization (EM) to find the parameters. We also used EM for K-Means clustering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandomly initialize all of the parameters. Calculate the log-likelihood.\nE-Step: Update the responsibilities assuming the means and variance-covariance matrices are known.\nM-Step: Estimate new means and variance-covariance matrices assuming the responsibilities are known. The means and variance-covariance matrices are calculated using weighted MLE where the responsibilities are the weights.\nCalculate the log-likelihood. Go back to step 2 if the log-likelihood improves by at least as much as the stopping threshold.\n\n\n\n\nThis algorithm is computationally efficient, but it is possible for it to find a local maximum log-likelihood without finding the global maximum log-likelihood.\n\n\n2.6.4 Example 4\nLet’s consider a policy-relevant example using data from the Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) Program.\nFirst, we pull the 2016 county-level estimates of the uninsured rate. We label a state as an expansion state if it expanded data before 2015-01-01. We use this date with 2016 data because of policy lags.\n\nlibrary(censusapi)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'censusapi'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:methods':\n\n    getFunction\n\nsahie &lt;- getCensus(\n  name = \"timeseries/healthins/sahie\",\n  vars = c(\"GEOID\", \"PCTUI_PT\"),\n  region = \"county:*\",\n  time = 2016\n) |&gt;\n  as_tibble()\n\nNext, we pull data from the Kaiser Family Foundation about the expansion dates of Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nstates &lt;- tribble(\n  ~state, ~state_fips, ~implementation_date,\n  \"Alabama\", \"01\", NA,\n  \"Alaska\", \"02\", \"2015-09-15\",\n  \"Arizona\", \"04\", \"2014-01-01\",\n  \"Arkansas\", \"05\", \"2014-01-01\",\n  \"California\", \"06\", \"2014-01-01\",\n  \"Colorado\", \"08\", \"2014-01-01\",\n  \"Connecticut\", \"09\", \"2014-01-01\",\n  \"Delaware\", \"10\", \"2014-01-01\",\n  \"District of Columbia\", \"11\", \"2014-01-01\",\n  \"Florida\", \"12\", NA,\n  \"Georgia\", \"13\", NA,\n  \"Hawaii\", \"15\", \"2014-01-01\",\n  \"Idaho\", \"16\", \"2020-01-01\",\n  \"Illinois\", \"17\", \"2014-01-01\",\n  \"Indiana\", \"18\", \"2015-02-01\",\n  \"Iowa\", \"19\", \"2014-01-01\",\n  \"Kansas\", \"20\", NA,\n  \"Kentucky\", \"21\", \"2014-01-01\", \n  \"Louisiana\", \"22\", \"2016-07-01\",\n  \"Maine\", \"23\", \"2018-07-02\",\n  \"Maryland\", \"24\", \"2014-01-01\",\n  \"Massachusetts\", \"25\", \"2014-01-01\",\n  \"Michigan\", \"26\", \"2014-04-01\",\n  \"Minnesota\", \"27\", \"2014-01-01\",\n  \"Mississippi\", \"28\", NA,\n  \"Missouri\", \"29\", \"2021-07-01\",\n  \"Montana\", \"30\", \"2016-01-01\",\n  \"Nebraska\", \"31\", \"2020-10-01\",\n  \"Nevada\", \"32\", \"2014-01-01\", \n  \"New Hampshire\", \"33\", \"2014-08-15\",\n  \"New Jersey\", \"34\", \"2014-01-01\",\n  \"New Mexico\", \"35\", \"2014-01-01\",\n  \"New York\", \"36\", \"2014-01-01\", \n  \"North Carolina\", \"37\", NA,\n  \"North Dakota\", \"38\", \"2014-01-01\", \n  \"Ohio\", \"39\", \"2014-01-01\",\n  \"Oklahoma\", \"40\", \"2021-07-01\", \n  \"Oregon\", \"41\", \"2014-01-01\", \n  \"Pennsylvania\", \"42\", \"2015-01-01\", \n  \"Rhode Island\", \"44\", \"2014-01-01\", \n  \"South Carolina\", \"45\", NA,\n  \"South Dakota\", \"46\", \"2023-07-01\", \n  \"Tennessee\", \"47\", NA,\n  \"Texas\", \"48\", NA,\n  \"Utah\", \"49\", \"2020-01-01\",\n  \"Vermont\", \"50\", \"2014-01-01\",\n  \"Virginia\", \"51\", \"2019-01-01\", \n  \"Washington\", \"53\", \"2014-01-01\",\n  \"West Virginia\", \"54\", \"2014-01-01\",\n  \"Wisconsin\", \"55\", NA,\n  \"Wyoming\", \"56\", NA\n) %&gt;%\n  mutate(implementation_date = ymd(implementation_date))\n\nsahie &lt;- left_join(\n  sahie, \n  states,\n  by = c(\"state\" = \"state_fips\")\n) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(PCTUI_PT)) |&gt; \n  mutate(expanded = implementation_date &lt; \"2015-01-01\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(expanded = replace_na(expanded, FALSE))\n\nWe use GMM to cluster the data.\n\nuni &lt;- select(sahie, PCTUI_PT)\n\nuni_bic &lt;- mclustBIC(uni)\n\nplot(uni_bic)\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, BIC suggests a model with three clusters.

If \\(\\theta\\) is a vector of parameters, then \\(L(\\theta |x) = f(x |\\theta)\\) is the likelihood function.\nWe often don’t know the exact number of latent groups in the data. We need a way to compare models with varying numbers of groups. Simply picking the model with the maximum likelihood will lead to models with too many groups.\nThe Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is an alternative to likelihoods that penalizes models for having many parameters. Let \\(L\\) be the likelihood, \\(m4\\) the number of free parameters, and \\(n\\) the number of observations.\n\\[\nBIC = -2log(L) + mlog(n)\n\\tag{2.4}\\]\nWe will choose models that minimize BIC. Ideally, we will use v-fold cross validation for this process.\n\n\n2.6.6 Example 5\nThe Mclust() function will try G = 1:9 when G isn’t specified. Mclust() will also try 14 different variance models for the mixture models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWe want to minimize BIC but library(mclust) is missing a negative sign. So we want to maximize the BIC plotted by library(mclust).

The example uses the MNIST database, which contains 70,000 handwritten digits. The digits are stored in 784 variables, from a 28 by 28 grid, with values ranging from 0 to 255, which indicate the darkness of the pixel.\nTo prepare the data, we divide each pixel by 255 and then turn the pixels into indicators with values under 0.5 as 0 and values over 0.5 as 1.

We will treat each pixel as its own Bernoulli distribution and cluster observations using mixtures of 784 Bernoulli distributions. This means each cluster will contain \\(784\\) parameters.\n\n2.7.1 Two Digit Example\nLet’s start with a simple example using just the digits “1” and “8”. We’ll use library(flexmix) by Leisch (2004). library(flexmix) is powerful but uses different syntax than we are used to.\n\nThe function flexmix() expects a matrix.\nThe formula expects the entire matrix on the left side of the ~.\nWe specify the distribution used during the maximization (M) step with model = FLXMCmvbinary().\n\n\nlibrary(flexmix)\n\nLoading required package: lattice\n\nmnist_18 &lt;- mnist |&gt;\n  filter(label %in% c(\"1\", \"8\")) |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(-label) |&gt;\n  as.matrix()\n\nThe starting assignments are random, so we set a seed.\n\nset.seed(20230612)\nmnist_18_clust &lt;- flexmix(\n  formula = mnist_18 ~ 1, \n  k = 2, \n  model = FLXMCmvbinary(), \n  control = list(iter.max = 100)\n)\n\nThe MNIST data are already labelled, so we can compare our assignments to the labels if we convert the “soft assignments” to “hard assignments”. Note that most applications won’t have labels.\n\nmnist |&gt;\n  filter(label %in% c(\"1\", \"8\")) |&gt;  \n  bind_cols(cluster = mnist_18_clust@cluster) |&gt;\n  count(label, cluster)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  label cluster     n\n  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1     1       1   482\n2     1       2  6260\n3     8       1  5610\n4     8       2   241\n\n\nFigure 2.4 shows the estimated \\(p_i\\) for each pixel for each cluster. The figure shows 784 \\(p_i\\) for \\(k = 1\\) and 784 \\(p_i\\) for \\(k = 2\\). We see that the estimated parameters closely resemble the digits.\nOf course, each digit can differ from these images because everyone writes differently. In some ways, these are average digits across many version of the digits.\n\nmeans_18 &lt;- rbind(\n  t(parameters(mnist_18_clust, component = 1)),\n  t(parameters(mnist_18_clust, component = 2))\n) |&gt;\n  as_tibble() |&gt;\n  mutate(label = NA)\n\n\nvisualize_digit(means_18, 1)\nvisualize_digit(means_18, 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) 1\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Estimated Parameters for Each Cluster\n\n\n\nThe BMM does a good job of labeling the digits and recovering the average shape of the digits.\n\n\n2.7.2 Ten Digit Example\nLet’s now consider an example that uses all 10 digits.\nIn most applications, we won’t know the number of latent variables. First, we sample 1,0002 digits and run the model with \\(k = 2, 3, ..., 12\\). We’ll calculate the BIC for each hyperparameter and pick the \\(k\\) with lowest BIC.\n\nset.seed(20230613)\nmnist_sample &lt;- mnist |&gt;\n  slice_sample(n = 1000) |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(-label) |&gt;\n  as.matrix()\n\nsteps &lt;- stepFlexmix(\n  formula = mnist_sample ~ 1, \n  model = FLXMCmvbinary(), \n  control = list(iter.max = 100, minprior = 0),\n  k = 2:12, \n  nrep = 1\n)\n\nsteps\n\n\\(k = 7\\) provides the lowest BIC. This is probably because digits like 3 and 8 are very similar. Next, we run the BMM on the full data with \\(k = 7\\).\n\nmnist_full &lt;- mnist |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(-label) |&gt;\n  as.matrix()\n\nmnist_clust &lt;- flexmix(\n  formula = mnist_full ~ 1, \n  k = 7, \n  model = FLXMCmvbinary(), \n  control = list(iter.max = 200, minprior = 0)\n)\n\nThe MNIST data are already labelled, so we can compare our assignments to the labels if we convert the “soft assignments” to “hard assignments”. Note that most applications won’t have labels.\n\nlabels &lt;- mnist |&gt;\n  bind_cols(cluster = mnist_clust@cluster)\n\ntable(labels$label, labels$cluster)\n\n   \n       1    2    3    4    5    6    7\n  0    5  357  282  289 4875    1  114\n  1   36  288   40   35    0 6319   24\n  2  114  166  652   73   50  163 4740\n  3  263  473 4786   80   41  260  228\n  4 3384 1779    4  139    7   53  476\n  5  325 2315 2367  173  109   59   73\n  6    9   86   41 4365   42  128 1247\n  7 3560 2395   21    0   25  234   30\n  8  257 2582 2369   57   32  445  109\n  9 3739 1797  109    5   26  136  137\n\n\nFigure 2.5 shows the estimated \\(p_i\\) for each pixel for each cluster. The following visualize the \\(784K\\) parameters that we estimated. It shows 784 \\(p_i\\) for \\(k = 1, 2, ..., 7\\) clusters.
